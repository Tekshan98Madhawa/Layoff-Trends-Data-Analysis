Introduction
The purpose of this analysis is to explore the relationship between layoffs and the amount of funding raised by companies across different industries and countries. We aim to determine whether companies that raised significant amounts of capital were able to avoid layoffs or whether there are patterns of layoffs within specific industries, company stages, or geographical regions.

Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this analysis contains records of layoffs from companies worldwide, with the following key fields:

Company: The name of the company.
Location: Headquarters of the company.
Industry: Sector in which the company operates.
Total Laid Off: Number of employees laid off.
Percentage Laid Off: Percentage of the workforce laid off.
Funds Raised: Total funds raised by the company (in millions).
Stage: Company's stage (e.g., Series B, Post-IPO).
Country: Country where the company is based.
Methodology
The analysis was conducted using a combination of SQL queries and data manipulation techniques. The following steps were taken:

Data Cleaning: Duplicates were removed, null values were handled, and data was standardized (e.g., trimming company names, formatting dates).
Exploratory Data Analysis: SQL queries were used to identify key trends in layoffs vs. funds raised, and data was grouped by company, industry, stage, and country for further insights.
Visualization: Key findings were visualized using charts (e.g., bar graphs, line plots) to better understand the relationship between layoffs and other variables.
Key Findings
1. Companies with High Layoffs vs. Funds Raised
This section focuses on companies that laid off a significant number of employees despite raising large amounts of capital:

Company	Total Laid Off	Funds Raised (in Millions)	Industry	Country	Stage
Company A	X employees	Y million	Tech	USA	Series B
Company B	X employees	Y million	Retail	UK	Post-IPO
2. Industry Insights
Certain industries, especially Technology and Real Estate, showed higher layoffs despite large amounts of funding raised. Companies in these sectors often face scaling challenges, leading to workforce reductions despite capital availability.

3. Impact of Company Stage
Series B: Startups in this stage experienced moderate layoffs. Despite substantial funding, companies still laid off a significant percentage of their workforce.
Post-IPO: Companies in the post-IPO stage had larger layoffs, likely due to pressures from investors and the market to achieve profitability.
4. Geographical Trends
Layoffs varied by region:

USA: Most layoffs were concentrated in the technology sector.
Europe: Countries like the UK and Germany saw layoffs in both retail and media sectors.
Conclusion
The analysis reveals that high levels of funding do not always shield companies from layoffs. While factors such as industry and company stage play a significant role, external market forces, such as economic downturns and the need for profitability, often override the availability of capital.

Further Exploration
Future analyses could explore:

Layoffs by Employee Role: Identifying which roles or departments are most affected during layoffs.
Temporal Trends: Examining how layoffs correlate with economic events or market conditions.
Startup Ecosystem: Investigating how early-stage startups handle layoffs compared to mature companies.
